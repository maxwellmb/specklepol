    The parameters of this detector have been hardcoded into the subclass based on values drawn from 
    brochures and user manuals. These parameters include:\n
    dark current rate - found in documentation \n
    read noise - found in documentation (Note that when a range of read noises was given in the documentation,
        the MAXIMUM read noise was always choosen. Read Noise generally increases as a function of frame rate
        and given the speckle applications of this project, we presumed that the maximum frame rate was desired.
        Presuming the maximum frame rate lead to the choice of the maximum read noise.)
    flat field - presumed to be zero \n
    include photon noise - presumed to be true \n
    max fps - The maximum FPS at the size most relevant to the VIPER Project. \n
    detector size - The size of the short length of the detector. Many detectors can have their regions of 
        interest reduced in order to increase frame rate. Some detectors reduce ROI into smaller sqaures 
        while others reduce ROI into rows with max length but reduced height. In the case of square ROIs
        the detector size corresponds to the side length of the square. In the case of rectangular ROIs
        the detector size corresponds the the length of the short side, as the long side remains unchanged. \n
    shutter type - The electronic shutter that determines the way in which photons are captured and then read out
        of the detector. Can be either Rolling or Global. \n
    detector type - The classification of the detector. Either EMCCD or some form of CMOS camera. \n
    quantum efficiency - The quantum efficiency of the detector calculated based on taking a weighted average
        of the QE curves given in documentation with the weights being the transmission ratios of the filters
        U, B, V, R, and I. \n

    Parameters
    ----------
    detector_grid : Grid
        The grid on which the detector samples.
    filter : string
        A letter indicating the filter from UBVRI. Relevant for computing the quantum efficiency.
    EM_gain: Scalar or None
        The EM multiplication gain of the EMCCD. Used to determine the read noise and if the full well depth is exceeded.
        None means EM Multiplicative noise will not be considered.
    EM_saturate: None or np.nan
        Choose the behavior of the detector if the full well depth is exceeded. If None, every instance that the full
        well depth is exceeded is replaced with the maximum full well depth. If np.nan, it is replaced with np.nan.
    subsampling : integer or scalar or ndarray
        The number of subpixels per pixel along one axis. For example, a
        value of 2 indicates that 2x2=4 subpixels are used per pixel. If
        this is a scalar, it will be rounded to the nearest integer. If

    Details can be found at: \n
    https://www.hamamatsu.com/resources/pdf/sys/SCAS0154E_C15550-20UP_tec.pdf \n

    The parameters of this detector have been hardcoded into the subclass based on values drawn from 
    brochures and user manuals. These parameters include:\n
    dark current rate - found in documentation \n
    read noise - found in documentation (Note that when a range of read noises was given in the documentation,
        the MAXIMUM read noise was always choosen. Read Noise generally increases as a function of frame rate
        and given the speckle applications of this project, we presumed that the maximum frame rate was desired.
        Presuming the maximum frame rate lead to the choice of the maximum read noise.)
    flat field - presumed to be zero \n
    include photon noise - presumed to be true \n
    max fps - The maximum FPS at the size most relevant to the VIPER Project. \n
    detector size - The size of the short length of the detector. Many detectors can have their regions of 
        interest reduced in order to increase frame rate. Some detectors reduce ROI into smaller sqaures 
        while others reduce ROI into rows with max length but reduced height. In the case of square ROIs
        the detector size corresponds to the side length of the square. In the case of rectangular ROIs
        the detector size corresponds the the length of the short side, as the long side remains unchanged. \n
    shutter type - The electronic shutter that determines the way in which photons are captured and then read out
        of the detector. Can be either Rolling or Global. \n
    detector type - The classification of the detector. Either EMCCD or some form of CMOS camera. \n
    quantum efficiency - The quantum efficiency of the detector calculated based on taking a weighted average
        of the QE curves given in documentation with the weights being the transmission ratios of the filters
        U, B, V, R, and I. \n

        value of 2 indicates that 2x2=4 subpixels are used per pixel. If
        this is a scalar, it will be rounded to the nearest integer. If
        this is an array, the subsampling factor will be different for
        each dimension. Default: 1.

class Prime_BSI(NoisyDetector):
    '''A subclass of NoisyDetector class based on the Prime BSI.\n

    Details can be found at: \n
    https://www.photometrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PrimeBSI-Datasheet_Rev_A4_-07312020.pdf \n

    The parameters of this detector have been hardcoded into the subclass based on values drawn from 
    brochures and user manuals. These parameters include:\n
    dark current rate - found in documentation \n
    read noise - found in documentation (Note that when a range of read noises was given in the documentation,
        the MAXIMUM read noise was always choosen. Read Noise generally increases as a function of frame rate
        and given the speckle applications of this project, we presumed that the maximum frame rate was desired.
        Presuming the maximum frame rate lead to the choice of the maximum read noise.)
    flat field - presumed to be zero \n
    include photon noise - presumed to be true \n
    max fps - The maximum FPS at the size most relevant to the VIPER Project. \n
    detector size - The size of the short length of the detector. Many detectors can have their regions of 
        interest reduced in order to increase frame rate. Some detectors reduce ROI into smaller sqaures 
        while others reduce ROI into rows with max length but reduced height. In the case of square ROIs
        the detector size corresponds to the side length of the square. In the case of rectangular ROIs
        the detector size corresponds the the length of the short side, as the long side remains unchanged. \n
    shutter type - The electronic shutter that determines the way in which photons are captured and then read out
        of the detector. Can be either Rolling or Global. \n
    detector type - The classification of the detector. Either EMCCD or some form of CMOS camera. \n
    quantum efficiency - The quantum efficiency of the detector calculated based on taking a weighted average
        of the QE curves given in documentation with the weights being the transmission ratios of the filters
        U, B, V, R, and I. \n

    detector_grid : Grid

    filter : string
        A letter indicating the filter from UBVRI. Relevant for computing the quantum efficiency.

        The number of subpixels per pixel along one axis. For example, a
        value of 2 indicates that 2x2=4 subpixels are used per pixel. If
        this is a scalar, it will be rounded to the nearest integer. If
        this is an array, the subsampling factor will be different for
